## About nodemon

Using the nodemon watcher speeds up working the the server. Each time you change server.js, 
nodemon will restart the server. 

1. npm install -g nodemon
2. Add to "scripts" in package.json 
    "start": "nodemon server.js localhost 3000"
3. npm start


Note: you need to install nodemon in Terminal with -g option for the "npm start" command to work.
Note: if you change the port in server.js, change "npm start" in package.json.
